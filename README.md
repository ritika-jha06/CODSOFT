# CODSOFT
Maintaining a Tech Internship Repository for all the tasks that I'll perform during the internship period as a Machine Learning Intern at @CodSoft.

# Movie Genre Classification
This repository contains a machine learning project for classifying movies into their respective genres based on metadata such as plot summaries, keywords, cast information, and more.

## 📚 Project Overview
Accurately predicting a movie's genre can enhance content recommendation systems and improve the search experience for users. In this project, we build and evaluate models to classify movies into one or more genres using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## 🛠️ Features
-> Text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, stopword removal)
-> Feature extraction using TF-IDF and word embeddings
-> Multi-label genre classification
-> Model training with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks
