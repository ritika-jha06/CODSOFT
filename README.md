# CODSOFT
Maintaining a Tech Internship Repository for all the tasks that I'll perform during the internship period as a Machine Learning Intern at @CodSoft.

# TASK 1:
## Movie Genre Classification
This repository contains a machine learning project for classifying movies into their respective genres based on metadata such as plot summaries, keywords, cast information, and more.

## 📚 Project Overview
Accurately predicting a movie's genre can enhance content recommendation systems and improve the search experience for users. In this project, we build and evaluate models to classify movies into one or more genres using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## 🛠️ Features
-> Text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, stopword removal)
-> Feature extraction using TF-IDF and word embeddings
-> Multi-label genre classification
-> Model training with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks

#TASK 2:
## 📌 Task 2: Spam SMS Detection
This task involves building a machine learning model to automatically classify SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam). The goal is to develop a text classification system that can help detect unwanted or malicious text messages using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Key Objectives:
->Preprocess and clean raw SMS text data
->Extract meaningful features using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings
->Train and evaluate various classifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression)
->Optimize model performance using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
->Evaluate results using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Dataset:
The dataset typically consists of labeled SMS messages with two categories: spam and ham.
